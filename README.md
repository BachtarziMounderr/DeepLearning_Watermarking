## Workshop Objective
Train participants to design and implement deep learning models for secure digital watermarking — addressing:
- Data collection and preprocessing  
- Dataset balancing using GANs  
- Deep feature extraction with CNN & Transformer backbones  
- Feature refinement using attention (CBAM)  
- Evaluation of robustness and separability
- Watermark Embedding & Extraction:**  
  Incorporation of logo embeddings (as feature vectors) into medical images for robust digital watermarking.  
  The trained or pre-extracted logo features are embedded within medical image representations, ensuring:  
  - high imperceptibility (visual quality preserved),  
  - resilience to noise and common image transformations,  
  - and recoverability of the watermark features during extraction.
